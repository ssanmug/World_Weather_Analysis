# World Weather Analysis

The purpose of this repository is to: 
- collect and analyze weather data across cities worldwide using OpenWeatherMap API 
- create an app called PlanMyTrip which receives input from users to derive a list of potential travel destinations based on the users' preferred weather conditions
- create a travel route between cities and a marker layer map for these potential travel destinations as part of an itinerary provided by the PlanMyTrip app using the Google Maps Directions API
